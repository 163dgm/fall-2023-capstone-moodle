Data Analysis

potential trends to look for:

- HW:

  - 3more questions on hw lead to better/worse performance

    - questions, grade/20
  - 2how close to deadline submission is, corresponding performance

    - look at moodle datasets, make separate csv files for each year
    - completed, grade/20
  - time taken and corresponding grade - not very helpful for performance, but cheating!

    - time taken, grade/20
  - 1time of day and corresponding grade

    - started on, grade/20
  - cheating/collaboration detection -- highlights certain student ids

    - find the average time taken for each hw assignment, find outliers for time taken
    - flag student IDs who score A or above (18/20 or above)
    - cross check outliers with those score A or above. flag them as cheaters
    - IP ADDRESSES??

      **- Submission Clusters:**

      * Identify clusters of submissions that occur around the same time (do not include deadline, since many students submit near the deadline). Sudden spikes or patterns where multiple students submit assignments simultaneously could be indicative of collaboration. Consider using visualization tools, such as histograms or time series plots, to highlight submission clusters. cross check with ip address; if same ip address and same submission time, then this may indicate collaboration/cheating
- LAB VS HW

  - more time given for assignments = better performance? --> compare average of lab grades (105 mins given) with avg of homework grades (usually 120 mins)
    - point out how labs have a 4 day time frame in which you can take it, while hw has a 7 day time frame in which you can take it. overall, students are given less time to complete labs than hw
- LAB:

  - more questions on lab lead to better/worse performance

    - questions, grade/20
  - how close to deadline submission is, corresponding performance

    - look at moodle datasets, make separate csv files for each year
    - completed, grade/20
  - time taken and corresponding grade

    - time taken, grade/20
  - time of day and corresponding grade

    - started on, grade/20
- MIDTERM VS. ASSIGNMENT:

  - compare students midterm grade vs their avg assignment grade. Are students who perform well on the midterm also performing well in the course as a whole? This could help identify the effectiveness of quizzes as an assessment tool.
- Final VS. ASSIGNMENT:

  - compare students final grade vs their avg assignment grade. Are students who perform well on the final also performing well in the course as a whole? This could help identify the effectiveness of quizzes as an assessment tool.

clusters of students by performance: 3-4 categories

- spotlights certain students and the reason WHY
- big picture idea
